You don’t need permission to gather your people and bring Ethereum Localism to life where you are. In fact, the movement depends on it. Your time, curiosity, creativity, and commitment to place are the most valuable assets we have. What you have to contribute, the movement needs—**what you bring is enough**.

**Start where you are, with what you have, and who you know.** We’ve assembled some tools and templates below to help spark and support your process—but there’s no one-size-fits-all. The real magic happens when people remix and adapt in ways that feel alive and relevant in their local contexts.

### Local Meetup

### Online Series  
Host a recurring online series to explore Ethereum Localism from wherever you are—whether seasonal, thematic, or experimental in format.

### Community Space  
Create or activate a local space where people can gather, collaborate, and explore regenerative tech, culture, and commons together.

### Cosmo-Local Gathering  
Bring your bioregion into conversation with the global network by hosting a cosmo-local convening rooted in place and shared inquiry.
