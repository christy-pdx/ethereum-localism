The idea for *ethereumlocalism.xyz* was seeded during the first General Forum on Ethereum Localism [(GFEL)](library/GFEL) in 2023, where we learned that the meme of Ethereum Localism was strongly resonant when there was a dedicated space to hold and nurture it. The forum revealed a growing interest in maintaining a resource hub dedicated to Ethereum Localism—one that could reflect the diversity of local experiments while connecting them into a cohesive field of practice.

By the end of the third GFEL gathering, hosted in Boulder, CO in February 2025, the time was right to begin. The Knowledge Garden concept emerged as a fitting format for a decentralized knowledge commons, and the communities behind it began building.

## The Initiative  

**ethereumlocalism.xyz** is an open knowledge garden and action-oriented research hub dedicated to propagating the meme and practice of Ethereum Localism. It acts as a connective tissue between local blockchain-based efforts and the broader Ethereum ecosystem, offering stories, tools, and tactics that demonstrate how Ethereum can empower geolocated, regenerative and participatory communities.

The project engages a global network of builders, long-time Ethereum contributors, and local organizers. These participants come from urban, rural, and hybrid environments—all exploring how Ethereum tools can support land-based and community-centered living. By providing a name and home for this niche within Ethereum culture, the initiative offers digital commons for those building local-first futures.

**Goals:**

- Steward a global network of locally-rooted Ethereum initiatives, builders, and organizers  
- Highlight stories of community practice and repeatable protocol, regeneration and resilience, and experimental governance  
- Make participation easy and open for aligned individuals around the world

## Tools & Infrastructure  

- **Core Platforms:** [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/), Obsidian, GitHub, [DAOHaus](https://daohaus.club/)  
- **Collaborative Stack:** Telegram and shared Google Docs  
- **Pre-existing Networks:** the GFEL community, Knowledge Garden stewards, Gitcoin

## Building in Practice  

- **February 2025** — Initiative launches at GFEL Boulder  
- **April 2025** — Telegram group and initial site go live  

- Contributors organize online co-working sessions, async collaboration, and community calls  
- A dedicated channel for development fosters transparency and shared ownership  

Governance is informal yet participatory: decisions are made by the most engaged contributors through collective dialogue and shared visioning.

---

## Lessons & Challenges  

- **Challenge:** Building collaboratively and continually as project stewards across time zones, and around existing life obligations and constraints. 
- **Lesson:** You can just do things. Especially when you're connected to and an active participant within communities that share your values.  
- **Advice to Others:** Build what you believe in! Communities of Practice and Knowledge Gardens are powerful containers for shared learning and progressive action.

## What’s Next?  

ethereumlocalism.xyz is growing! Next milestones include:  
- Expanding the [Library](/knowledge-garden/library) and [Resources](/knowledge-garden/resources)  
- Improving usability and community onboarding  
- Publishing more stories and protocols from Ethereum localist communities  
- Publishing a major UI update in time for GG24  

**We invite anyone drawn to the practice of Ethereum Localism—whether you're a builder, organizer, dreamer, or doer—to get involved. Join us in cultivating the commons and co-creating regenerative digital and physical futures.**
