PizzaDAO emerged during the early pandemic, when small businesses in Philadelphia were struggling and mutual aid efforts were gaining urgency. Snax ([@snack_man](https://x.com/snack_man)), a longtime community builder and early participant in the crypto-art world, asked: *How can communities own their local small businesses?*

At the same time, a vibrant NFT community on Clubhouse was energized by the idea of throwing a decentralized global pizza party for **Bitcoin Pizza Day**—the anniversary of [Laszlo Hanyecz’s legendary 10,000 BTC pizza purchase](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-glossary/what-is-bitcoin-pizza)—to support independent pizzerias and their communities. The convergence of **memes, mutual aid, and crypto culture** catalyzed PizzaDAO’s formation.

**Founding Goal:** Bring small businesses—especially pizzerias—onchain in ways that allow for community ownership, transparent funding, and mutual support.

**PizzaDAO is a global cooperative experiment** that uses blockchain tools to throw pizza parties and fund independent pizzerias. Its flagship event is the [**Global Pizza Party**](https://globalpizza.party), held every May 22. In 2024, the event activated over **220 cities in 80+ countries**, serving pizza to more than **15,000 people**.

**PizzaDAO is a decentralized cultural vehicle**: open-source, values-driven, and powered by joy, food, and community lore.

**The DAO:**
- Funds pizza for grassroots Ethereum and web3 meetups around the world
- Onboards small businesses into crypto infrastructure using friendly tools and guidance
- Partners with aligned orgs like Gitcoin, GreenPill, and NFT projects
- Uses NFTs (like the 314-artist *Rare Pizzas* collection) to bootstrap and sustain its treasury

**Blending decentralized funding and coordination with IRL celebration—PizzaDAO is a live demo of what Ethereum Localism can look like at scale.**

## Outcomes & Impact

- **$1M+ spent on pizza** since 2021  
- **Over 400 local relationships** with pizzerias and organizers  
- **15,000+ people** fed in a single day during Bitcoin Pizza Day 2024  
- **DAO-first funding model** using NFTs, grants, and volunteer effort  
- **Cultural impact**: PizzaDAO serves as a replicable meme-vehicle for web3 onboarding, literacy, and localism

---

## Community Practice

PizzaDAO’s culture is highly participatory and intentionally fun! Rigid structures are avoided in favor of permeable boundaries and living documentation.

- **Onboarding with personality**: New members are asked their favorite topping + mafia movie to generate their “pizza mafia name” (e.g., *Al Pachicken* or *Pepperoni Corleone*).
- **Open and async coordination**: Workstreams and meeting agendas are tracked in public spreadsheets and managed through [crew.pizzadao.xyz](https://crew.pizzadao.xyz), an impressive Google sheets workspace.
- **Play and LARPing**: Community members are encouraged to step into playful roles and take initiative without gatekeeping.
- **Global-local rhythm**: The community maintains an international presence while supporting highly local activations. PizzaDAO’s community operates across Twitter Spaces, Discord, Telegram, and IRL events, embracing both synchronous and asynchronous engagement.
- **Advocate cultivation**: Organizers who champion the mission in their own regions are empowered to host events and tap DAO support.

**Guiding Values:**  
- “Yes and” improvisational thinking  
- Permissionless contribution  
- Joyful experimentation  
- Radical hospitality  
- Trust through transparency

## Lessons & Challenges

**Challenges faced:**
- Many pizzerias are unfamiliar with or understandably wary of crypto—PizzaDAO continually adapts language, tools, and messaging to build trust and educate.
- DAO coordination at global scale required flexible tools and constant iteration of onboarding.
- Differentiating between “audience” and “community” meant shifting focus from followers to collaborators.

**Resolutions and Lessons:**
- Lead with value, not jargon.
- Use joyful rituals (nicknames, parties) to build trust before introducing tools.
- Celebrate and support community organizers who bring new people in.
- Open documentation lowers the barrier to participation.

## Repeatable Tactics

> **“Put any word in front of DAO and build for the Schelling point of what a DAO for that word would be. Go for it!”**

- Use a familiar, joyful meme (pizza!) to build cross-cultural bridges  
- Activate annual rituals to provide rhythm and cohesion  
- Combine IRL and URL tools to keep communities informed and connected  
- Use NFTs for collective fundraising and community signaling  
- Empower regional leads and decentralize logistical support

---

## Looking Forward

PizzaDAO’s next big leap is **acquiring its first community-owned pizzeria**—transitioning from event support to long-term, DAO-governed ownership of local infrastructure. Cowabunga! 🍕😎

As PizzaDAO evolves, it aims to:
- Strengthen regional partnerships
- Expand onboarding materials for non-crypto-native communities
- Serve as a template for *DAO-powered local ownership* in other industries
