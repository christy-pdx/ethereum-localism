Fun DAO provides IRL community members with the opportunity to join a low barrier to entry, low overhead [DAO](/knowledge-garden/library/Shared-Definitions) for the purposes of playing with novel coordination tools and governance mechanisms, while growing and strengthening the local web3 network in the process! This project is not meant to take significant time or energy from its members, but be a casual gathering and an opportunity to experiment with a new interface on occasion. The primary goal of Fun DAO is to decentrally facilitate and have FUN!

Fun DAO:
– Provides a place for novices to join their first DAO and see how it works.
– Provides a place for novices and veterans alike to be continually exposed to new web3 mechanisms that might help them in other projects.
– Provides valuable feedback to the teams building these novel onchain tools.
– Provides a place for community members to get to know each other, and potentially brainstorm other projects and workgroups that might eventually animate a diverse local DAO ecosystem.

### Ingredients
- A local group of web3 enthusiasts interested in active participation in an ongoing hands-on learning experiment.
- A DAOHaus DAO for onchain membership. You may not have a treasury to start (or ever?).
- A DAO Telegram channel, or any effective communications/coordination channel.
- Optional: Implement Hats ([hatsprotocol.xyz](https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz)) for DAO member role attribution and administration. FUN!

### Instructions
1. Every month the DAO will decide on a local group outing. The outing could be just for fun - a sports game or a park barbeque - or it could be purpose driven, like a community garden
2. Each cycle you’ll use a unique web3 coordination tool to decide on the outing (e.g., jokerace.xyz, quadratic voting, conviction voting). Which tool is used is determined through group discussion and initiative.

### Account: Fun DAO PDX
Fun DAO PDX had its first outing on Saturday, January 27th, 2024, to see a free art show at the Oregon Contemporary - Georgie Friedman’s BREATHING – LIGHT. Our first outing was decided using jokerace, where the art show beat out indoor golf and Multnomah falls, among others.

Though the DAO has 10 onchain members, the outing’s attendance was fifteen, with newcomers joining to say they don’t yet understand how to set up a wallet but would like to be included. To this end the DAO coordinated dedicated onboarding hours (hosted at Ethereal Forest’s affiliate community space, Bridgespace) on the second Tuesday of every month, complimenting our EthPDX meetup which occur monthly on first Wednesdays.

The first cycle onboarded a handful of community members to self-custody wallets while being the first experience with jokerace for many more of us. The next cycle is likely to use Pairwise voting through General Magic. (etherealforest.org/blog)
