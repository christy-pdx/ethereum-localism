Welcome to the **Ethereum Localism Library** - a curated, growing collection of resources, articles, research, and practical insights that are helping form an intellectual foundation for our movement.

*For curated resources from across the ecosystem visit the [Resources](/knowledge-garden/resources) page.*

---

## 📖 [Shared Definitions](library/Shared-Definitions)
A living glossary of core concepts—Ethereum Localism, cosmo-localism, bioregionalism, and more—to align our language as we co-create.

## 📁 [Ethereum Localism](library/Ethereum-Localism)
General content on the Ethereum Localism thesis.

## 📁 [Field Reports](library/Field-Reports)
Real-world case studies and narratives around the messy and inspiring work of experimentation and implementation.

## 📁 [Implementation Guides](library/Implementation-Guides)
Detailed resources for how to implement Ethereum Localist principles and toolkits.

---

## 📰 [Movement Signals](library/Movement-Signals)
Dispatches, articles, and project updates from the growing ecosystem of Ethereum Localism and aligned movements.

## 🪴 [Community Digital Garden](library/Community-Digital-Garden)  
Personal writings, digital gardens, and evolving reflections from Ethereum Localists around the world.

## 🖼️ [Cultural Outputs](/knowledge-garden/resources/gallery)
Creative expressions from the Ethereum Localism ecosystem—art, media, memes, rituals, and zines that reflect, expand, question, and enrich our shared narratives.

---

## 📁 [Local DAO Summer](library/Local-DAO-Summer)
Documentation from Local DAO Summer, our reoccurring online gathering on localist applications of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. 

## 📁 [GFEL](library/GFEL)
Documentation from past General Forums on Ethereum Localism.

## 📁 [Extitutions and Open Protocols](library/Extitutions-and-Open-Protocols)
Research and theory into how both web and analogue protocols operate beyond institutional enclosures.

## Emerging Themes

These thematic clusters represent the next phase of Ethereum Localism’s evolution. New sections will be created as more entries and prototypes accumulate.

**Applied Cosmo-Localism**  
Living examples where cosmo-local principles meet on-the-ground application — bridging the global commons with bioregional action.  

**Regenerative Financial Infrastructure**  
Innovations in commons-based finance, bioregional investment systems, and post-extractive capital architectures.  

**Bioregional Finance Prototypes**  
Frameworks like [Bioregional Financing Facilities (BFFs)](/knowledge-garden/library/Implementation-Guides/BioFi-Project) that operationalize decentralized finance in service to place, ecology, and culture.

## Contribute  

The Ethereum Localism Library is a living, growing commons — and your voice is vital.  

Whether you're experimenting with local DAOs, stewarding bioregional ecosystems, crafting regenerative finance models, designing new governance patterns, or weaving culture through story and art — your insights, field notes, and frameworks belong here.

If you have knowledge, experiments, or creative works to share that align with Ethereum Localism’s spirit of applied cosmo-localism and decentralized solidarity, we invite you to contribute. Together, we are weaving the intellectual and practical foundations for the worlds to come.
