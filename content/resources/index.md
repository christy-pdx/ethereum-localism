Tools, guides, and communities we’ve found useful—from across the Ethereum Localism ecosystem and beyond. For deeper dives, the [Library](/knowledge-garden/library) has [Shared Definitions](/knowledge-garden/library/Shared-Definitions), [Field Reports](/knowledge-garden/library/Field-Reports), and [GFEL](/knowledge-garden/library/GFEL) documentation.

Sections are arranged by theme; browse what fits your interests. Links without ↗ stay in the Knowledge Garden; links with ↗ go to external sites (source in parentheses).

**To contribute**: Add your initiative to the registry by using the Edit on GitHub link at the top of the page to propose changes directly—GitHub will prompt you to fork and open a pull request if you're not a collaborator. You can also reach out or see the [Contributon Guide →](/knowledge-garden/contribution-guide). Within each section (except Ethereum), entries are listed alphabetically.

→ [Chat about Ethereum Localism with CosmoGPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67bcda8bdffc8191bb45c9aa78064051-cosmo) — A chatbot trained on our gatherings; useful for cosmo-local coordination questions. (OpenAI)
