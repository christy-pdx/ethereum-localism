Tools, guides, and communities we’ve found useful—from across the Ethereum Localism ecosystem and beyond. For deeper dives, the [Library](/knowledge-garden/library) has [Shared Definitions](/knowledge-garden/library/Shared-Definitions), [Field Reports](/knowledge-garden/library/Field-Reports), and [GFEL](/knowledge-garden/library/GFEL) documentation.

Sections are arranged by theme; browse what fits your interests. Links without ↗ stay in the Knowledge Garden; links with ↗ go to external sites (source in parentheses).
