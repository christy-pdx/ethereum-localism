A public directory of communities, DAOs, and other localist experiments using Ethereum-based tools. Registry entries power the [interactive map on our homepage](/)—which also includes initiatives from [Field Reports](library/Field-Reports) and allied organizations around the world. Entries are grouped by region; **Global** communities have distributed networks with place-based local activations. See [Implementation Guides](library/Implementation-Guides) for how-to resources.

**Want to add your initiative?** Use the Edit on GitHub link above to add it directly, or [reach out to the curators](/knowledge-garden/contribution-guide).

Entries are listed in alphabetical order by initiative name within each region. Please add new entries in alphabetical order. Listings are reviewed by curators before going live.
