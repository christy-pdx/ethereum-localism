# Knowledge Garden Tag Index

Tags help organize and discover content across the Knowledge Garden. Each note in the [Library](/knowledge-garden/library) (and some in [Resources](/knowledge-garden/resources)) can include a `tags` array in its frontmatter. Tags appear on **Recent Notes** cards and power the **Popular Tags** in the sidebar—clicking a tag shows all notes with that tag.

**For contributors:** When authoring content, add 2–4 tags from the taxonomy below. Use the `category/subcategory` format (e.g. `theme/ethereum-localism`). See the [Contribution Guide](/knowledge-garden/contribution-guide) for metadata details.

**Note:** Featured content on the homepage uses a separate schema (`title`, `description`, `ctaLabel`, `ctaHref`) and does not use tags. Tags apply to Library and Resources markdown pages.

### Proposing New Tags

The taxonomy below will grow as the garden grows. If you have a term that does not fit existing categories, propose it when contributing—consider format, theme, place, value, or issue. Tags should be lowercase, use hyphens for multi-word terms, and follow the `category/subcategory` structure.
